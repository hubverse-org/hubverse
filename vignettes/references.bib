	abstract = {For practical reasons, many forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death counts in the context of the current Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic are issued in the form of central predictive intervals at various levels. This is also the case for the forecasts collected in the COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/). Forecast evaluation metrics like the logarithmic score, which has been applied in several infectious disease forecasting challenges, are then not available as they require full predictive distributions. This article provides an overview of how established methods for the evaluation of quantile and interval forecasts can be applied to epidemic forecasts in this format. Specifically, we discuss the computation and interpretation of the weighted interval score, which is a proper score that approximates the continuous ranked probability score. It can be interpreted as a generalization of the absolute error to probabilistic forecasts and allows for a decomposition into a measure of sharpness and penalties for over- and underprediction., During the COVID-19 pandemic, model-based probabilistic forecasts of case, hospitalization, and death numbers can help to improve situational awareness and guide public health interventions. The COVID-19 Forecast Hub (https://covid19forecasthub.org/) collects such forecasts from numerous national and international groups. Systematic and statistically sound evaluation of forecasts is an important prerequisite to revise and improve models and to combine different forecasts into ensemble predictions. We provide an intuitive introduction to scoring methods, which are suitable for the interval/quantile-based format used in the Forecast Hub, and compare them to other commonly used performance measures.},

	abstract = {Combining predictions from multiple models into an ensemble is a widely used practice across many fields with demonstrated performance benefits. Popularized through domains such as weather forecasting and climate modeling, multi-model ensembles are becoming increasingly common in public health and biological applications. For example, multi-model outbreak forecasting provides more accurate and reliable information about the timing and burden of infectious disease outbreaks to public health officials and medical practitioners. Yet, understanding and interpreting multi-model ensemble results can be difficult, as there are a diversity of methods proposed in the literature with no clear consensus on which is best. Moreover, a lack of standard, easy-to-use software implementations impedes the generation of multi-model ensembles in practice. To address these challenges, we provide an introduction to the statistical foundations of applied probabilistic forecasting, including the role of multi-model ensembles. We introduce the hubEnsembles package, a flexible framework for ensembling various types of predictions using a range of methods. Finally, we present a tutorial and case-study of ensemble methods using the hubEnsembles package on a subset of real, publicly available data from the FluSight Forecast Hub.},
