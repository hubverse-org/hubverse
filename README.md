## Overview

A collection of packages that enables collaborative modeling exercises
through a unified framework for aggregating, visualizing, and evaluating
forecasts. This package is designed to make it easy to install and load
multiple ‘hubverse’ packages in a single step.

## Installation

You can install the development version of hubverse from

  and work with data in a modeling hub
- [hubEnsembles](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubEnsembles/) for
  ensemble methods to combine model outputs
- [hubVis](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubVis/) for plotting model
  outputs
- [hubUtils](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubUtils/) for lightweight
  utility functions
- [hubExamples](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubExamples/) for example
  data in the hubverse format
- [hubEvals](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubEvals/) for evaluating
  model outputs
- [hubValidations](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubValidations/) for
  validating modeling hubs and their model output
- [hubAdmin](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubAdmin/) for
  administrating a modeling hub
- [hubCI](https://hubverse-org.github.io/hubCI/) for continuous
  integration tools
